#### 4\. Close a tab with Ctrl+W

Close the current tab with Ctrl and W key. No need to take the mouse to the top and look for the x button.

#### 5\. Accidentally closed a tab? Reopen it with Ctrl+Shift+T

This is my favorite Google Chrome shortcut. No more ‘oh crap’ when you close a tab you didn’t mean to. Use the Ctrl+Shift+T and it will open the last closed tab. Keep hitting this key combination and it will keep on bringing the closed tabs.

#### 6\. Close the entire browser window with Ctrl+Shift+W

Done with you work? Time to close the entire browser window with all the tabs. Use the keys Ctrl+Shift+W and the browser window will disappear like it never existed.

#### 7\. Switch between tabs with Ctrl+Tab

Too many tabs open? You can move to right tab with Ctrl+Tab. Want to move left? Use Ctrl+Shift+Tab. Press these keys repeatedly and you can move between all the open tabs in the current browser window.

You can also use Ctrl+0 till Ctrl+9 to go to one of the first 10 tabs. But this Chrome keyboard shortcut doesn’t work for the 11th tabs onward.

#### 8\. Go to the search/address bar with Ctrl+L

Want to type a new URL or search something quickly. You can use Ctrl+L and it will highlight the address bar on the top.

#### 9\. Bookmark the current website with Ctrl+D

Found something interesting? Save it in your bookmarks with Ctrl+D keys combination.

#### 10\. Go back in history with Ctrl+H

You can open up your browser history with Ctrl+H keys. Search through the history if you are looking for a page visited some time ago or delete something that you don’t want to be seen anymore.

#### 11\. See your downloads with Ctrl+J

Pressing the Ctrl+J keys in Chrome will take you to the Downloads page. This page will show you all the downloads action you performed.
